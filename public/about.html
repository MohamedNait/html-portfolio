<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, My name is Mohamed Nait, I'm from Morocco. 
  I'm a Web Developer and I really love my native city Ouarzazate, southern Morocco. 
  Although I'm living elsewhere right now, I'm still tracking what's going on there 
  especially events related to the art and cinema. And that's why I created my first 
  website to showcase cinematographical events in Ouarzazate.
  I hope you like it!</p>
<p>I also love Adventures in my Country, especially when it comes to sport adventures, 
  and as you know people come to Morocco from all part of the world to practice 
  some extreme sports, like windsurfing, biking, climbing, hayaking and canyoning...
  I used to purchase some sport events like Rallying because there is a stage of Morocco 
  Desert Challenge of Rally settled every year to Moroccan Sahara. So enjoy guys following
  Morocco extreme sports in my website.</p>
  <p>Stay cool and peace...</p>
